## Basics

The Core principle “**Delay execution of JavaScript as much as possible.**”

Qwik is all about 2 terms

- **Resumable** (no JS, and no hydration)
- **Progressive**

## Resumability by example in Qwik

1. run the application at the server
2. serializing it’s state into HTML
3. send the HTML over to the client
4. client is ready to go
5. the additional JS is ONLY loaded on demand (on interactivity) when it is have to be loaded for certain action - it is called [precision lazy-loading](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/concepts/progressive/) (progressive)

### Example by analogy

You can think of it (resumable framework) as virtual machine

1. You start a virtual machine - Linux for instance
2. there is a bootup process when you have to wait for login screen and then login
3. you open the some program and do your work there
4. once you are done you save the VM
5. what happens under the hood is that VM creates a file with this state
6. then you to send it to your colleague
7. your colleague opens it on totally different physical machine
8. and he gets the exact same state, that you left on your machine
9. he won’t go through the bootup process - he can interact with program imediately
10. hydration is exactly the same, it is the bootup process

### Example by comparison

Hydration = replay the app

It just runs twice:

1. execute all logic in the server
2. serialization process on the server
3. on the client it downloads all non-lazy loaded JS
4. application needs to be re-executed - since framework need to figure out component boundaries, where are the listeners, what is the DOM structure and so on
5. reconciliation process, when framework need to determine what changed and when to put the listeners
6. Now the page is interactive

On the other hand resumable frameworks

1. execute all logic in the server
2. serialization process on the server
3. prefetch on service workers
4. Now the page is interactive
